## Setup

`templateR` is a template designed to make developing new R packages easy by providing:  

  - **DESCRIPTION, vignettes/, tests/, R/, man/, inst/**: Basic skeleton for the package itself.  
  - **README.Rmd**: Auto-populates based on the *DESCRIPTION* file (that can be knit to create *README.md*). Also contains [badges](https://github.com/GuangchuangYu/badger) that automatically update themselves.   
  - **inst/hex/hexSticker.Rmd**: Template for creating [hex stickers](https://github.com/GuangchuangYu/hexSticker). 
  - **.github/workflows/\*.yml**: [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/understanding-github-actions) workflow files that will automatically trigger code checks and pushing images to [DockerHub](https://hub-stage.docker.com/) every time you make a push to your GitHub repo (from [`r_workflows`](https://github.com/neurogenomics/r_workflows)).
  - **inst/CITATIONS** : Allows users of your package to call `citation("<packageName>")`. Also used to auto-populate the *README.Rmd*.  
  
To get started, simply click on the green **Use this template** button at the top right of the `templateR` repo. 

### GitHub Secrets 

Before pushing changes to your new R package, 
you will need to add two [GitHub Secrets](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/encrypted-secrets):  

1. `PAT_GITHUB`: Speeds up installations and gives access to private repos on GitHub Actions. You can generate your very own Personal Authentication Token using [these instructions](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token).  
2. `CODECOV_TOKEN`: Allows [code coverage](https://app.codecov.io/) results to be displayed via the `badger::badge_codecov()` at the top of the *README.Rmd*. This [Codecov](https://app.codecov.io/) token is repository-specific and can be found [here](https://app.codecov.io/gh/`r owner`/`r pkg`). 
3. `DOCKER_TOKEN`: Allows GitHub Actions to push to the [neurogenomicslab DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/orgs/neurogenomicslab) account. Ask a fellow [Neurogenomics Lab](https://www.neurogenomics.co.uk/) member for this token.  


### GitHub Pages

The [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/understanding-github-actions) workflows included in this template will automatically create a documentation website for your package via [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). This requires several initial setup steps (you only need to do these once per repo):  

1. After *check-bioc-docker.yml* has successfully run on Ubuntu for the first, a new branch will appear in your repo called "gh-pages".  
2. In the **Settings** tab of your repo, go to **Pages** on the left. Then under **Source** select `"branch: gh-pages"` and `"root"` from the respective dropdown menus. Finally, click the **Save** button.  

*Note*: If you don't have admin access to your repo, you will need to ask someone who does to change this for you.

### `r description`
 
If you use ``r pkg``, please cite: 

<!-- Modify this my editing the file: inst/CITATION  -->
> `r citation(pkg)$textVersion`

## Installation 

```R
if(!require("remotes")) install.packages("remotes")
