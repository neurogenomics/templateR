source_all(
  path = "R",
  pattern = "*.R$",
  packages = NULL,
  envir = globalenv(),
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{path}{Directory containing R files.}

\item{pattern}{File name pattern to search for.}

\item{packages}{Packages to load.}

\item{envir}{an \R object specifying the environment in which the
    expressions are to be evaluated.  May also be a list or an integer.
    The default \code{\link[base]{baseenv}()} corresponds to evaluation in the base
    environment.  This is probably not what you want; you should
    typically supply an explicit \code{envir} argument, see the
    \sQuote{Note}.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments passed to \link[base]{sys.source}.}
}
\value{
Null
}
\description{
Source all R files in a directory at once. 
Also loads selected libraries. 
This function can be useful when developing R packages, 
instead of rebuilding the entire package every time you make a change 
(which is a more robust way to checking the package works, 
but is much slower).
